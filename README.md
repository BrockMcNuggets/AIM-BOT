# AIM-BOT
This is an ancient bot I wrote for AIM using AppleScript. The code is a mess -- and even I have difficulty understanding much of it now (was written around 2003 for a program that no longer even runs on modern macOS and for a system that has shut down). Still, the bot worked better than any AIM bot I saw, and still works better than any bot I have seen in any chat room.
